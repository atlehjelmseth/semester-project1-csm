      <h2>
        <span class="title">Cosmology:</span>
        Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky
        Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the
        universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies
        that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the
        stars to travel by. Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from
        early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of
        the planets in our solar system.

      <h2>
        <span class="title">Evolution:</span>
        For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
        question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here?
        Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework
        for exploring and understanding our place in this world. Discover the
        origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have
        evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the
        creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos,
        and a number of dinosaurs too.

      <h2>
        <span class="title">Biology and Medicine:</span>
        From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology
        are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny
        world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their
        quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding
        of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of
        medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the
        discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant. Many of our
        great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also
        from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat
        us to it.

      <h2>
        <span class="title">Robotics and AI:</span>
        The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
        intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home
        applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here.
        You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot. Ecology As
        we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet,
        the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a
        sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet. In our
        ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face
        including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we
        also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter
        future.
