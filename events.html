            <span class="title">Visiting Professor of Aeronautics:</span> It is
            our pleasure to announce that Prof Sheila Widnall from the
            Massachusetts Institute of Technology will be delivering 3 lectures
            on the development of aeronautics and where the future lies in this
            exciting ‘space’.

          <p>
            <span class="title">Night in the Museum:</span> Get your family
            together for an exciting night in the museum as you sleep over
            beside dinosaurs and science displays. Bring your own sleeping bag
            and get ready to rough it as we go exploring the wonders of science.
          </p>

            <span class="title">Energetica Exhibition on Loan:</span> On loan
            from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition
            is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series of
            installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
            elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to
            ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control
            wind to create power.
