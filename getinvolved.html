        <p>
          <span class="title">Support:</span> There are various ways you can
          support the museum. Donations are very welcome and are an important
          way we keep this museum open and accessible to the whole community.
          You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museum’s
          collections. If you have some item or collection that you think others
          would enjoy, please let us know by contacting our Collections
          Department and they will be able to assist you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="title">Volunteer:</span> A number of people volunteer
          their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and ready for
          visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including
          getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, access to
          staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and
          volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and
          strategies for the museum. You can help volunteer in a number of
          different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out more
          about how you can get involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="title">Internships:</span> Are you interested in working
          in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun and excitement of sharing the
          wonders of nature with people? Well you could be just the right person
          to enjoy an internship at the museum. You’ll be learning from a number
          of different academics and people who are passionate about science and
          sharing it with the wider community.
