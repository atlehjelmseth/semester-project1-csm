          Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed to
          making science accessible to all. Over the course of human history,
          science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind,
          water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the
          very building blocks of life itself.

      The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience
      the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion
      to continue the exploration of the world around us. We believe science
      should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through
      exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many
      varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed
      for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life
      (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when
      everyone’s gone home).
